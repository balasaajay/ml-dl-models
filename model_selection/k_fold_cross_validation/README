k-fold Cross-Validation:

1. Cross-validation is a statistical method/resampling procedure used to estimate the skill of machine learning models.
2. It is commonly used in applied machine learning to compare and select a model for a given predictive modeling problem because it is easy to understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that generally have a lower bias than other methods.
3. Trains on 10 different test sets ad calculates accuracies individually

The general procedure is as follows:

  Shuffle the dataset randomly.
  Split the dataset into k groups
  For each unique group:
  Take the group as a hold out or test data set
  Take the remaining groups as a training data set
  Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
  Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
  Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores

Why?
 It generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill
