- Discovering categories or groups in the data
- works with multidimentional features

step1: choose number of clusters K
2: select random K points that will be centroids of cluster (may or may not be in dataset)
3: assign datapoint to closest(Eucledian distance) centroid
4. compute and place the new centroid in each cluster
5. reassign each data point to new closest centroid. If any reassignment go to step 4 otherwise FINISH

K-means random initialization trap:
1. selection of centroids at the initital step can determine the outcome of the algo - this is not good.
2. to avoid above - use K-means++ algo

Choosing right number of clusters:
1. within cluster sum of squares (WCSS)
2. Elbow method - look at the point where the change in drop is not significant for picking number of clusters (X - # of cluster, Y - WCSS values)
