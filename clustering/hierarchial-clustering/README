Hierarchial clustering
2 types:
  1. Agglomerative (Bottom-up)
  2. Divisive (top-down)


Agglomerative HC:
Step 1: Make each data point a cluster => N clusters
2: take two closest data points and make them one cluster => N-1 clusters
3: take 2 closest clusters and make them one cluster => N-2 clusters
4: repeat step-3 until there is only one cluster

Distance between clusters 
1. Eucledian Distance

- Data is stored in Dendrograms 
  - set dissimilarity threashold to break into sclusters
  - number of clusters from the number of points the threshold line crosses
  - take threshold that crosses the largest vertical distance line
