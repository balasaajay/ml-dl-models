Reinforcement learning
- widely used in robotics
- good actions will be rewarded and bad will be punished


Multi armed bandit problem
- explore and exploit otherwise regret
- regrest is when the output os non-optimal
- identify which ad will maximize profits and gets max clicks

UCB vs Thompson

UCB:
1. Deterministic algo - straightforward, no randomness
2. requires update every round - value incorporated for next round

Thompson:
1. Probabilistic algo - we generate random values, different everytime
2. It can accomodate delayed feedback - not needed to update algo everytime
3. Faster than UCB


UCB needs 1000 to identify the ad
Thompson sampling was able to find it in 500 runs
