LDA:
- Dimesnionality reduction technque
- In addition to finding the component axises, LDA we are interested in axes 
that maximize the seperation between multiple classes


Goal:
- project feature space onto small subspace while maintaining class-discriminatory info
- PCA and LDA are linear transformation techniqes
- LDA is supervised because of the relation to dependent variable
