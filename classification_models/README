Metrics for classification_models

1. False Postitives and negatives
  1. False Postitives - we predicted +ve outcome but it was False
  2. False Negative - we predicted -ve but it is true

2. Confusion Matrix:
  1. Accuracy rate = correct/total
    - just accuracy rate is not good. (Accuracy paradox -> solved by CAP curve)
  2. Error rate = wrong/total

3. CAP Curve (cumulative accuracy profile)
  - area under the model curve
  - randome model vs good model vs perfect model
  - AR = (aP/aR)
  - aP - area under perfect model - area under random model
  - aR - area under good model - area under random model
  Note: CAP vs ROC 
   - receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
  
NOTES:

If your problem is linear, you should go for Logistic Regression or SVM.

If your problem is non linear, you should go for K-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree or Random Forest.

Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes when you want to rank your predictions by their probability.

SVM when you want to predict to which segment your customers belong to.

Decision Tree when you want to have clear interpretation of your model results

Random Forest when you are just looking for high performance with less need for interpretation.
