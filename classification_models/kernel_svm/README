Kernel SVM

- Can be used when data is not linearly seperable
- non-linearly seperable data with incresed dimensions can become linearly seperable
- but, higher dimensions is resource intensive. Kernel trick will help here.

Kernel trick:
- Gaussian RBF kernel - radial basis function
- Sigmoid kernel - similar to sigmoid function
- Polynomial Kernel
