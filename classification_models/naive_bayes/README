Bayes Theorem:

- P(A/B) = (P(B/A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Naive Bayes:
- WHy "Naive"?  - because it assumes independent assumptions
- P(X) - marginal likelihood
    - Likelihood a randomly selected data point from dataset exhibits features similar to data we are about to add
- More than 2 features? - more compute intensive
- Non-linear classifier
- Less overfitting
