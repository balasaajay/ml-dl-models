NLP:

- Types
  1. NLP
  2. Deep NLP (Seq2Seq models - powerful models)

- Classical vs Deep Learning
1. If/else rules (chatbots) - very Old
2. Audio freq component analysis (Speech recognition) (Non deep learning)
  - try to identify wave forms from some speech samples with predefined samples
  - mathematical comparision 
  - no neural networks
3. Bag of Words model (Classification)
  - classify words with +ve or -ve results
4. Convolutional NN for text recognition (classification)
  - mostly used for image recognition/ video processing
  - words embedded into matrix and same logic as images are applied
5. TF-IDF model
6. Seq2Seq (many apps)
