Random forest is a techniqe in ensemble learning

Step 1: pick random K data points from dataset (bootstrapping dataset)
step 2: Build a decision tree for these K
step 3: choose a number N tree of trees you want to build and tepeat steps 1 & 2
step 4: for new data point, make each one of Ntree trees predict the value of Y and assign new data point the average across all predicted vals

Bagging = Booststrapping + aggregating
Out-of-bag dataset - datasets that got missed in bagging process. can be used to measure model accuracy
to optimize - use more features in each step
